<!--

My name is Varya, I have experience in development working in small to large projects across the
world. The things I have been doing are about frontend and most of the project was around something which is
currently called "design systems". In previous years, this activity had many different names like "pattern libraries",
"styleguides", "component approach", "atomic design". But whatever the naming, it included developing encapsulated
interface components. A while ago it was BEM CSS and XSL for templating, then a few JavaScript frameworks whose names
history does not remember, a little bit of Angular and currently React. Of course, since it has always been something
modular, there were various building and documenting solutions.
